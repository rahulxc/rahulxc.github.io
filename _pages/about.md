Beyond the confines of corporate Data Science, I'm also immersed in:

2. **Football Analytics:** A fervent football enthusiast, I delve into data to extract richer narratives of the game. Take a look at some of the analytical work I've done [link to work].
3. **Public Data Analysis:** I take pleasure in transforming Public Data into lucid, insightful graphs that illuminate paths for informed decisions.
